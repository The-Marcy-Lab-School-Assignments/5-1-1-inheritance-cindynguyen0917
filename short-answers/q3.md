# Question
What is polymorphism? Show an example in a code snippet.

# Answer
Polymorphism is what allows subclasses or children to inherite properties and behaviors of mutiple super classes or parents while being able to incorporate their own functionality. Hence the name, 'many forms', classes can be MANY things at once. 

```
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.friends = [];
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friends.push(friend)
    console.log(`Hi ${friend}, my name is ${this.name}, nice to meet you!`);
  }
}

class Programmer extends Person {
  makeFriend(friend) {
    this.friends.push(friend);
    console.log('tap tap tap');
  }
}

class Musician extends Person {
  constructor(name, instrument) {
    super(name);
    this.instrument = instrument;
  }
  makeFriend(friend) {
    super.makeFriend(friend)
    console.log(`I can play the ${this.instrument}. Do you know any instruments?`);
  }
}
```
