# Question
What's the difference between an `instance` method and a `class` method?

The difference between an `instance` method and a `class ` method is how they're used. An `instance` method speific to the new instance of the class and is not shared anywhere else. A `class` method belongs to the class and is shared amongst all of the instances.
