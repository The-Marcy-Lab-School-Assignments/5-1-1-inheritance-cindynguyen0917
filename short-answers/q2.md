class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  doActivity(activity) {
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${activity}`);
  }
}

class Athlete extends Person {
  constructor(name, age, sport) {
    super(name, age);
    this.favoriteSport = sport;
  }
  exercise() {
    console.log(`${this.name} loves to play ${this.favoriteSport} for exercise.`);
  }
}
